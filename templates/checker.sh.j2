An NFS server has been installed and the entire /export directory has been shared out. To set up the nfs-auto-provisioner; you just need to run the following command after "openshift-install wait-for bootstrap-complete --log-level debug" has finished...

	$(basename $0) nfs-setup

Thats it! Right now, this is an "opinionated" setup (there is no "how do I set this up for..."). For now, this is what you get.

Once it's setup, create a PVC for the registry (an example of one has been provided)

	oc create -f /usr/local/src/registry-pvc.yaml -n openshift-image-registry

Check that with "oc get pv" and "oc get pvc -n openshift-image-registry".

Then set the registry to use this NFS volume. (you may need to remove the emptyDir if you set it beforehand)

	oc patch configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io cluster --type=json -p '[{"op": "remove", "path": "/spec/storage/emptyDir" }]'
	oc patch configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io cluster --type merge --patch '{"spec":{"storage":{"pvc":{ "claim": "registry-pvc"}}}}'


Check the status by watching "oc get pods -n openshift-image-registry"

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WARNING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I've detected that you're using as small disk for your /export directory. OpenShift uses a LOT of storage and it's recommended to use a disk of AT LEAST 100GB. You can do one of two things...

	1) Add a disk to this server and mount it on /export (RECOMMENDED)
	2) Grow the / volume (not ideal but okay)

If you proceed to use this server how it is, you void ANY chance of help from me on slack or github :)

Make sure your permissions are right once you've mounted over /export (EL8 shown below, on EL7 the owner is: nfsnobody)

	chown nobody:nobody /export
	chmod 775 /export

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
